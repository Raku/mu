Here are papers which are currently coming up in converstation.

This list is intended to be more transient and speculative than
READTHEM, but less transient, and perhaps more curated, than #perl6.
It was prompted by my having to grovel over several weeks of irc log
to dig up the name of a paper I wanted to read.

Adding comments about the papers is welcome/encouraged.

Papers which stick around for a while, or are highly thought of, or
relevant could be moved to READTHEM.
