Welcome to the Pugs VICTUALS file.

This file is very important -- perhaps even more so than its cousin,
the venerable MANIFEST file.

Pugs programmers often work crazy hours, under extreme pressure, and
without adequate sleep. Accordingly, there is a real danger they may
fall ill due to poor eating habits and lack of proper nutrition.

Moreover, in times of extreme stress special enchanted provisions
(such as blue sugar cubes from the frig) can provide that vital
energy boost needed to get the job done.

This file lists foodstuffs known to be beneficial to Pugs hackers.
Please feel free to add your own personal favourites to this file.

Enjoy!
