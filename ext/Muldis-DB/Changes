---------------------------------------------------------------------------

2007-09-22   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.4.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.4.0.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.4.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at this time, if ever, since it is currently released only as
    part of the Perl6-Pugs project (in its ext/Muldis-DB/ subdirectory),
    which sets its own less frequent release schedule.  The rest of this
    Changes entry refers only to the Perl 5 version.

    * This release is a snapshot to show a particular mid-way point in a
    large sequence of changes.  To summarize, the public API of Muldis DB
    has been rewritten, documentation for that API was added (including an
    example), and both the Example Engine and the Validator suite were
    (substantially) updated to conform to the new API.  However, the
    Example Engine is still incapable of executing any tasks, so that
    aspect is unchanged from before.  The next release should flesh out
    Example so that it executes some tasks.

    * Removed the file Literal.pm; Muldis DB now uses Perl Hosted Abstract
    Muldis D (composed of Perl array refs, hash refs, scalars), as
    described in Language::MuldisD::PerlHosted, rather than Literal
    objects, as its data|code interchange format.  This makes things a lot
    simpler, easier to use, and better performing.  All of the other .pm
    files in this distribution, which used Literal.pm, were updated
    accordingly, which is further described below.  Also removed the
    t/MDB_10_Literal_Simple.t test file.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers brought up to 0.4.0.

    * Minor updates to all versioned files such that most references to the
    project name were changed to "Muldis DB" from "Muldis::DB".

    * (DB.pm, Interface.pm, Example.pm)  Updates to various
    main/introductory documentation.  Half rewrote/prepended the
    DESCRIPTION of DB.pm.  Added a small initial DESCRIPTION to each of
    Interface.pm, Example.pm.  Further minor edits to other sections.

    * (Interface.pm)  Rewrote 90% of the code to provide a substantially
    different, though similar, API.  The new_dbms function of the
    Muldis::DB::Interface module now has a modified version of what code
    used to be in the constructor submethod of ::DBMS (it is the code that
    loads an Engine and invokes it to make a ::DBMS object), rather than
    the former being an optional wrapper for the latter.  All remaining
    ::Interface::\w+ named packages of Interface.pm are now just roles that
    declare method interfaces but don't implement any, and the
    correspondingly named Engine classes must inherit said roles and
    implement the methods; they are no longer wrapper classes that do
    validation on behalf of, and then invoke, the Engines, but rather the
    Engines must do their own input validation now, and user applications
    are now invoking the public Engine classes directly.  The
    ::Engine::Role(|::\w+) roles that used to be in Interface.pm are now
    gone, as they are now redundant; the new ::Interface::\w+ are like what
    they used to be.  The new Interface.pm do not declare constructor
    interfaces, since users should now only be making objects indirectly by
    way of methods of another class.  The ::HostGateVar class/role was
    renamed to ::Var, the ::HostGateRtn was renamed to ::ProcBinding, and a
    similar ::FuncBinding was added.  The ::(DBMS|Var|(Func|Proc)Binding)
    roles were further substantially altered, with some methods renamed and
    others added.  Perhaps the most substantial difference of the new API
    for actual functionality is that there is no distinct "prepare" method
    any more, rather all action methods are of the "execute" (now called
    "call") variety.  How this works is you first call() a DDL routine, its
    argument being the definition of the (now always named) user-defined
    routine you want to compile; then you call() that newly created
    routine.  In a related fashion, if you just want to invoke existing
    system or (already loaded / in-mounted-database) user-defined routines,
    you can just call() them like they were Perl routines, with no separate
    DDL/prepare step.  The (Func|Proc)Binding roles aren't actually needed
    for anything, as the DBMS role provides call_(func|proc) methods, which
    in either case just alias to an already compiled routine, but the 2
    Binding roles are provided for now in case they may add some efficiency
    due to less repeated input validation or such.

    * (Interface.pm)  Rewrote and/or added 90% of the INTERFACE pod; unlike
    the old API which had practically no documentation, the new API is
    fully documented.  Also added an initial SYNOPSIS documentation block,
    which illustrates invoking the system-defined relational join operator,
    where the arguments and result are Perl-lexical variables; this is the
    first actual example code for using Muldis DB, however contrived.

    * (Example.pm)  Rewrote the Example.pm code to conform to the changed
    API declared by Interface.pm.  The new version implements the root
    module, the ::DBMS and ::Var classes, but not the ::(Func|Proc)Binding
    classes.  Also, the interface-role implementing classes were all
    renamed aside from interface-conformity, specifically "::Public" was
    added to all their names, that signifying that these are the only
    classes that applications would directly invoke.  This file stands to
    be substantially updated in the next releases, but for the most part
    most Example code will be put in other files, with Example.pm limited
    to providing just the public interface.

    * (PhysType.pm, Operators.pm)  Made a minimal set of updates to these
    files to bring them up to date with the current Muldis D type or
    routine names for what they implement, and to remove any references to
    Literal.pm.  These files stand to be substantially updated, or even
    replaced in the next releases.

    * (Validator.pm)  Rewrote the foods/suppliers/shipments scenario, which
    is basically all the code, so it uses the new API in Interface.pm; this
    version is barely half the code size of the old one, but it doesn't
    create a user-defined routine to combine the tasks to be done; an
    additional version will be provided in a subsequent release that does.
    The SYNOPSIS, plus the MDB_50_Validate_Example.t, were minor updated.

    * (Validator.pm)  Added a &does_ok to Validator.pm, which in the Perl 6
    Validator.pm is a modified copy of the &isa_ok of Test.pm but it tests
    with .does rather than .isa; in the Perl 5 Validator.pm, the new
    &does_ok is just a symbolic alias for the Test::More &isa_ok; in any
    event, the rest of both versions of Validator.pm now invokes &does_ok
    rather than &isa_ok, to keep their code bases more similar.

    * (SeeAlso.pod)  Updated the PROSPECTIVE MULDIS DB EXTENSIONS section
    mainly to bring various names, terminology, and references up to date
    with design changes.  Any package names containing "Literal" now have
    "PHMD" instead, and any docs refering to "Muldis DB AST nodes" now
    refer to "Perl Hosted Muldis D".  Re-added the
    Muldis::DB::AST::StringRepr module that was removed in release 0.1.0
    under the new name Muldis::DB::PHMD::Translate::ConcreteMuldisD (it's
    not part of Literal.pm anymore).  Other small renames and changes.

    * Updated the TODO file.

2007-09-14   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis DB version 0.3.2 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.3.2.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.3.2 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * Removed the file Copying.pod; it isn't particularly useful anymore.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm 0.3.2.  The other pre-existing versioned
    files are unchanged.

    * (DB.pm)  The whole Muldis DB core, that is, all code in this
    distribution, has been re-licensed under the GNU Lesser General Public
    License version 3 or later (LGPLv3+).  Also, the current plan is that
    the LGPLv3+ will be used as the license of many separately distributed
    Muldis DB extensions started by the same author, such as some
    implementations over SQL databases, or such as example code in
    tutorials/cookbooks; or some extensions would be under other
    GPLv3-compatible licenses.

    * Muldis DB version 0.3.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.3.1.tar.gz.  Muldis DB version 0.3.1 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * Renamed DB.pod to DB.pm, and added an empty dummy package declaration
    of Muldis::DB to it, all for the sole purpose of helping the CPAN
    indexer link to this distribution properly; it doesn't work when the
    namespace file is plain pod.  For similar reasons, the version number
    of DB.pm will now always be kept in sync with the whole-distribution
    version number declared in the Makefile.PL.

    * New file versions are: DB.pm and Copying.pod 0.3.1.  The other
    pre-existing versioned files are unchanged.

    * (DB.pm, Copying.pod)  The license of Muldis DB has been simplified
    to no longer be the duality of the GPL and Affero GPL, as the Affero
    GPL option is dropped; this is because the Affero option didn't seem to
    provide any clear benefit, and the GPL is regardless compatible with
    the Affero GPL with respect to combining works into larger works, which
    is all that is truly important.

    * (DB.pm, Copying.pod)  The file DB.pm has been re-licensed under the
    Lesser GPL, while the rest of this distribution remains under the GPL.
    While not immediately the case (due to technicalities), in the near
    future, that will mean that the LGPL will cover all mandatory
    components (a minority), and the GPL all or most optional components of
    the Muldis DB framework.  Accordingly, the file LICENSE/LGPL was added
    to this distro, which contains the text of the LGPL version 3.0.

    * Muldis::DB version 0.3.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.3.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.3.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version.

    * What was Muldis-DB at version 0.2.0 and earlier, has been split in 2,
    with the parts to be Language-MuldisD and Muldis-DB, each at version
    0.3.0 and later.  Prior to the split, both the Perl 5 and Perl 6
    versions of Muldis-DB contained identical copies of what became
    Language-MuldisD; after the split, neither Muldis-D had a copy.

    * All versioned files had their version numbers brought up to 0.3.0.

    * This release saw no code changes at all.  About half of SeeAlso.pod
    was stripped out, since that stayed only with Language-MuldisD.

    * This is the Muldis-DB-0.3.0 file manifest:

    * Muldis::DB version 0.2.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.2.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.2.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * Renamed AST.pm to Literal.pm, and split up DB.pm into DB.pod and
    Interface.pm.  Any code that used to be spelled Muldis::DB::AST or
    Muldis::DB is now spelled Muldis::DB::Literal and
    Muldis::DB::Interface.  Following these changes, lib/Muldis/DB.pod is
    still the "main" file for documentation purposes, but for code
    purposes, both Literal.pm and Interface.pm are now used directly.

    * New file versions are: DB.pod and Literal.pm and Interface.pm and
    Language.pod and Validator.pm and Example.pm 0.2.0.

    * Updated Literal.pm to remove all exported functions that trivially
    wrap an object constructor, updated any uses in other files to call
    constructors directly.  Also renamed ::(Bool|Order|Int|Blob|Text)Lit to
    remove the "Lit", and ::(|Quasi)(Tuple|Relation)Sel to remove the
    "Sel", and likewise updated any refs to said.

    * In both Literal.pm and PhysType.pm, renamed any classes named
    (TypeInvo|TypeDict|ExprDict|ValueDict)(|NQ|AQ) to (_\1|\1|Quasi\1)
    respectively, and refs to said.

2007-07-11   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.1.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.1.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.1.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * This is a major release that focuses on overhauling or defining part
    of the Muldis D meta-model / system catalog, which is essential for
    supporting any user-defined DBMS entities, that is, for doing anything
    remotely useful.  Said overhaul is expected to be staged over 3-4
    consecutive releases, of which the current one is essentially just
    updating documentation; not much code was changed by this release.

    * New code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.1.0.

    * As of this release, all pod-only files now also have version numbers,
    shown in the VERSION docs by NAME, like code-containing modules do; the
    initial version numbers are all 0.1.0.

    * Muldis D now has 2 representation formats (Concrete Muldis D,
    Abstract Muldis D) rather than 3 (relations, ASTs, strings).

    * Updated SeeAlso.pod to remove the proposal for a separately
    distributed Muldis::DB::AST::StringRepr module; instead,
    Muldis::DB::AST will parse and generate Concrete Muldis D by itself.

    * Rearranged any relevant docs and code so that the most important core
    scalar types are now in the order [Bool, Int, Blob, Text] and the
    relation type factory Maybe now appears after Set.

    * Muldis D now has a new scalar data type, "Order", which is an
    enumeration (like "Bool" is) of 3 values: [Increase, Same, Decrease];
    it is the result type of any binary comparison operator that underlies
    the likes of less|greater-than or min|max or sorting operations.  Both
    AST.pm and PhysType.pm were updated to include this type.

2007-06-29   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.1.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.1 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * New code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm 0.0.1.

    * The primary purpose of this release is to re-license Muldis::DB under
    actual free software licenses, specifically version 3 of the GPL family
    of licenses, which the Free Software Foundation formally published on
    2007 June 29th.  By contrast, the previous Muldis::DB releases were
    under an expiring proprietary license, with just the promise of a free
    re-license to come.  Accordingly, the file LICENSE/GPL was added to
    this distro, which contains the text of the GPL version 3.0.

    * This release also includes a collection of small documentation
    updates and fixes, such as the following:  We now use the official
    typography for the names 'TTM' and 'D' and such.  Added a DOCUMENTATION
    READING ORDER section to the README file.  Added the 2007 June 4th
    Muldis::DB namespace registration (to the official CPAN module list)
    notice to the Changes file.  Updated parts of DB.pm and Copying.pod
    concerning licensing matters.  This release has no code changes.

2007-06-20   Darren Duncan <perl@DarrenDuncan.net>

    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at all.  The rest of this Changes entry refers only to the
    Perl 5 version, specifically the portions that were not split-off into
    Language-MuldisD following release 0.2.0.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 Muldis-DB distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::DB::\w+.

    * Initial code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm and PhysType.pm and Operators.pm 0.0.0.

    * As of this release, Muldis-DB is officially in pre-alpha development
    status.  A lot of documentation and functionality is present, but a lot
    isn't.  What is mostly done is the higher level documentation plus an
    alpha-quality but fundamentally stable public API implementation.  What
    is mostly undone is the reference engine implementation, the test
    suite, and documentation of the API details.  What is already present
    should be sufficient to begin study of Muldis-DB such that it can
    actually be put to use within the next few weeks or months as Muldis-DB
    is fleshed out.  Also, it should be possible now to start writing code
    that uses or extends it.
