    * Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 5 is released on CPAN as
    Muldis-DB-0.0.0.tar.gz.  Muldis::DB version 0.0.0 for Perl 6 is not
    released at this time, if ever, since it is currently released only as
    part of the Perl6-Pugs project (in its ext/Muldis-DB/ subdirectory),
    which sets its own less frequent release schedule.  The rest of this
    Changes entry refers only to the Perl 5 version.

    * This is the first release of the Perl 5 Muldis-DB distribution, and
    the first release of any distribution to contain Perl 5 modules named
    Muldis::DB::\w+.

    * This is the initial file manifest:

    * Initial code file versions are: DB.pm and AST.pm and Validator.pm and
    Example.pm and PhysType.pm and Operators.pm 0.0.0.

    * As of this release, Muldis-DB is officially in pre-alpha development
    status.  A lot of documentation and functionality is present, but a lot
    isn't.  What is mostly done is the higher level documentation plus an
    alpha-quality but fundamentally stable public API implementation.  What
    is mostly undone is the reference engine implementation, the test
    suite, and documentation of the API details.  What is already present
    should be sufficient to begin study of Muldis-DB such that it can
    actually be put to use within the next few weeks or months as Muldis-DB
    is fleshed out.  Also, it should be possible now to start writing code
    that uses or extends it.
