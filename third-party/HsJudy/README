I pasted my summer of code application, which describes roughly what's this
going to be. As time pass it'll become more proper README file =)

Fast Mutable Collection Types for Haskell
=========================================

# Synopsis
Develop Judy[1] bindings (a C library that implements fast sparse dynamic
arrays) for Haskell presenting APIs conforming as much as possible to the
existent Haskell library interfaces, like Data.Map and Data.Array.MArray.


# Benefits to the community
Creating Judy bindings was suggested in the Haskell mailing list[2], and all
Haskell software that uses common data structures like Maps and Arrays would
benefit from a faster implementation.

The project idea[3] was suggested by a Pugs (Perl 6 implementation in Haskell)
developer, so these bindings could also benefit the Perl6 community.


# Deliverables
A binding for the Judy library, including all its four types: mapping from
words to bits (Judy1), from words to values (JudyL), from strings to values
(JudyHS) and from array-of-bytes to values (JudyHS).

The API for the binding will match existing APIs of similar functionality in
Haskell libraries, allowing minimal effort to change a program to use these new
implementations. When possible, try to reduce this effort to just changing an
import clause in the Haskell program.


# Project Details
Some work[4] has already been done in Judy1 (mapping from words to bits)
bindings for Haskell, and this would be a good place to start. The project
divides naturally in three phases:

* Implement communication between Haskell and the library. This involves
using the Haskell's foreign function interface (FFI). The binding should
allow Haskell data types to be used as values.

* Design an API based on existing Haskell libraries. This involves studying the
Haskell API and seeing which ones would have Judy-based support, good
candidates are Map, IntSet and IntMap. Doing an interface for DiffArray was
suggested, too. It's possible that no Haskell API matches some
functionalities (like 'unbounded' Arrays); in that case new interfaces will
be created.

* Benchmark. Measure speed of the new bindings against that of previous
implementations. Other nice tests would be measuring the performance impact
in any entries of 'The Great Computer Language Shootout'[5], in the Pugs[6]
project and in RBR[7] (bioinformatics related software).


# Bio
I'm a 5th-year computer engineering undergraduate at Campinas State University
(Unicamp), in Brazil. I've been involved with free software for almost 10 years
now, beginning as a Linux user and progressing from there.

In 2006 I started to study the Haskell programming language on my own, reading
tutorials and articles, the mailing list and spending time on Haskell's IRC
channel. This semester I'm developing a Compiler Construction Lab project in
Haskell.

The school semester ends by early July, so until then I'll be splitting my time
between the project and some university courses. Once 'summer' vacation
(actually here in Brazil it will be winter) begins I'll be able to fully
dedicate myself to the project.

I have already begun studying Haskell and doing some experiments with
Haskell<->C FFI. This project would be a great opportunity for me to learn more
about the language, which I consider to be one of the most elegant, and
possibly contribute something very concrete to the Haskell community.
