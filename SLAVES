If you provide a service related to pugs, perl6 or #perl6, please add
yourself to the list.

speckbot                                moritz

Both Auzon and pmurias have access the server on which p6eval and the svn bots
run, so if something went wrong and moritz_ isn't available, you can prod
them instead.
