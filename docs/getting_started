Getting Started with Perl 6

(This is mostly just a skeleton with a few key URLs; feel free to flesh it out,
improve the formatting etc.)


Learning Perl 6

  Unfortunately, there doesn't yet seem to be much in the way of tutorials for
  people new to Perl 6.
  
  These are a few resources you may want to try reading:
  
  * Quickref
  
  Concise summaries of how to do various common things in Perl 6.  Probably
  too terse to serve as a tutorial, but useful nonetheless.
  
  http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/docs/quickref/
  (or docs/quickref/ in your local copy)
  
  * Examples
  
  http://svn.openfoundry.org/examples/
  (or examples/ in your local copy)
  
  * Synopses
  
  The official Perl 6 design documents, as maintained by @Larry.  Can be a
  little hard to follow sometimes, particularly for newcomers, but you may
  want to give them a try anyway.
  
  http://svn.perl.org/perl6/doc/trunk/design/syn/  (official repo)
  http://dev.perl.org/perl6/doc/synopsis.html      (HTML versions)
  
  * perl6-language
  
  http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl6.language


Installing Pugs

  * Windows
  
  Windows users who don't want the hassle of building Pugs themselves should
  try the binaries in PXPerl.
  
  http://pxperl.com/
  
  * Other Platforms
  
  Use your favourite Subversion client to grab the latest revision from the
  official Pugs repository.
  
  http://svn.openfoundry.org/pugs/

  You can also try getting one of the releases from CPAN, but if you're going
  to build it yourself anyway, you might as well try the latest SVN revision.

  Pugs is written in Haskell, so you'll need a recent version of GHC to build
  it.  (As of writing, 6.4.1 is recommended; 6.4 works on some platforms.)
