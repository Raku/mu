Declaring subroutines

    Basic subroutine declaration

        Positional parameters

            sub foo ($bar, @baz, %grtz) {...}
            # Global (our()) subroutine &foo, taking a scalar, an array,
            # and a hash.
            foo(42,        @array,        %hash);          # works
            foo(bar => 42, baz => @array, grtz => %hash);  # works as well
            foo(:bar(42),  :baz(@array),  :grtz(%hash));   # ditto
            # Mixing named and positional arguments is allowed, too:
            foo(42, :baz(@array), :grtz(%hash));           # works

            Positional parameters are required by default.

        Named parameters

            sub foo (:$named_only) {...}
            foo 42;                # illegal
            foo named_only => 42;  # ok
            foo :named_only(42);   # ok

            Named parameters are optional be default.

        Optional parameters

            sub foo ($bar?) {...}
            sub foo ($bar is optional) {...}
            foo();    # ok
            foo(42);  # ok

            sub foo (:$bar?) {...}  # allowed, but could be written as
            sub foo (:$bar)  {...}  # as named parameters are optional by
                                    # default.

            You can specify defaults:

            sub foo ($bar = 42) {...}
            foo();          # $bar is 42
            foo(17);        # $bar is 17

            sub foo (:$bar = 42) {...}
            foo();          # $bar is 42
            foo(:bar(17));  # $bar is 17

            Defaults are calculated at runtime and can even refer to preceding
            parameters:

            sub foo ($bar, $baz = grmbl($bar)) {...}

        Required parameters

            sub foo (:$bar!) {...}             # Required named parameter $bar
            sub foo (:$bar is required) {...}  # same

            sub foo ($bar!) {...}   # allowed, but could be written as
            sub foo ($bar)  {...}   # as positional parameters are required
                                    # by default.

        Slurpy parameters

            Slurpy arrays slurp all remaining positional arguments:

            sub foo ($a, $b, *@rest) {...}
            foo 1,2,3,4,5;  # $a is 1, $b is 2, @rest is (3,4,5)
            foo 1,2;        # $a is 1, $b is 2, @rest is ()

            Slurpy hashes slurp all remaining named arguments:

            sub foo ($a, $b, *%rest) {...}
            foo 1,2,3,4,5;  # error: "Too many positional arguments"
            foo 1,2, :foo<bar>;  # $a is 1, $b is 2, %rest is (foo => "bar")

        "is rw"

            By default, all parameters are readonly aliases:

            sub foo ($var) { $var = 42 };
            my $bar = 17; foo($bar);  # dies: "Cannot modify readonly variable"

            "is rw" causes *no* readonly proxy to be created:

            sub foo ($var is rw) { $var = 42 };
            my $bar = 17; foo($bar);  # works, $bar is 42 after the function call

        "is copy"

            "is copy" copies the variable, the original will remain unaffected:
            
            sub foo ($var is copy) { $var = 42 };
            my $bar = 17; foo($bar);  # works, but $bar unchanged

            (This is the same as Perl 5's "my $var = shift" idiom.)

            Note that "is rw" and "is copy" only refer to the first level of a
            structure:

            sub foo (@array) { @array[42] = 17 }
            foo @some_array;  # works, even though @array is not "is rw";
                              # @some_array[42] changed to 17

            sub foo (@array) { push @array, 17 }
            foo @some_array;  # does not work ("Cannot modify readonly
                              # variable")
            
            sub foo (@array is rw) { push @array, 17 }
            foo @some_array;  # does work, 17 appended to @some_array

            Similarily, "is rw" and "is copy" may not do what you think they do
            on references:

            sub foo (Ref $ref) { $$ref = 17 }
            foo $some_ref;  # works, $$some_ref changed to 17

            sub foo (Ref $ref) { $ref = \$other_var }
            foo $some_ref;  # dies ("Cannot modify readonly variable"
            
            sub foo (Ref $ref is rw) { $ref = \$other_var }
            foo $some_ref;  # works, $some_ref changed to \$other_var

        Rebinding parameters

            The following code is legal and does not die:

            sub foo ($var) { $var := $some_other_var; ... }
            foo 42;
            foo $some_var;

            But the original containers are not modified in any way, neither 42
            nor $some_var get rebound, only &foo's $var does no longer refer to
            42 or $some_var, but to $some_other_var.

        parameter types]

    Specifying the scope of a declaration

        sub foo {...}
        # our() subroutine, may be called before the declaration:
        foo(...); sub foo {...}  # legal
        # (Note that this is sugar for
        #   BEGIN { our &foo := sub (...) {...} })
        
        my sub foo {...}
        # Lexical (my()) subroutine, may not be called before the declaration.
        # Only visible in the scope in which it was declared:
        { my sub foo {...}; foo(...) }  # legal
        { foo()                      }  # illegal
                                        # ("Can't find subroutine &foo")

        our sub foo {...}
        # our() subroutine, may not be called before the declaration.

        sub *foo {...}
        # Really global subroutine, visible in all scopes.

    "is rw" on a subroutine

        "is rw" applied to a subroutine causes *no* readonly proxy to be
        created around the return value of a subroutine:

        sub foo { $some_var }
        foo() = 42;  # error: "Cannot modify readonly variable"

        sub foo is rw { $some_var }
        foo() = 42;  # works, $some_var set to 42

        sub foo is rw { 17 }
        foo() = 42;  # still does not work -- 17 is a constant
        # Instead use:
        sub foo is rw { my $var = 17 }
        foo() = 42;  # works

    The "Proxy" class

        Following the "assignments should look like assignments" rule, usage of
        "is rw" for accessor-like subroutines is encouraged. You can use the
        "Proxy" class to validate input:

        sub foo () is rw {
            return new Proxy:
                FETCH => { ...code to return on get... },
                STORE => -> $new { ...code to run on assignment... };
        }
        say foo();
        foo() = 42;

        Note that assigning a proxy to a variable with = will loose the proxy's
        magicalness:

        my $var = foo();
        $var = $invalid_input;  # works; STORE not called

        You have to use binding (:=) instead:

        my $var := foo();
        $var = $invalid_input;  # STORE called

Calling subroutines

    Whitespace matters

        foo 42;           # calls &foo, one positional argument (number 42)
        foo(42);          # same, the parens are subcall parens (postfix .())
        foo (42);         # same, but the parens are grouping parens

        foo 42, 23;       # two positional arguments (42 and 23)
        foo(42, 23);      # same

        foo (42, 23);     # one positional argument (the array (42, 23))

    Parentheses matter

        foo bar => 42;    # one named argument (42)
        foo :bar(42);     # same
        foo(bar => 42);   # same, the parans are grouping parens
        foo(:bar(42));    # same, the parans are grouping parens

        foo (bar => 42);  # one positional argument (the pair (bar => 42))
        foo (:bar(42));   # same, the parens mark the pair to be a Pair object,
                          # not a named argument

    Splatting

        foo $pair;        # one positional argument ($pair)
        foo *$pair;       # one named argument
                          # ($pair.value passed by the name $pair.key)

        foo @array;       # one positional argument (the array @array)
        foo *@array;      # many positional arguments
                          # (@array's contents are passed positionally)

        foo %hash;        # one positional argument (the hash %hash)
        foo *%hash;       # many named arguments
                          # (%hash.values are passed by the names %hash.keys)
