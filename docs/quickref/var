Secondary Sigils (also known as "twigils"):

There were threads on p6l about unifying all variables which concern the OS or
the VM ($*UID, $*PROGRAM_NAME, etc.) into two variables, $?ENV (compile-time
environment) and $*ENV (runtime environment). Larry did like the idea, but
"ENV" is probably to overloaded to mean the hash of environment variables
(which would be found under $*ENV.environment or somesuch).
