Further notes:
* Mail::Summary::Tools is used in the instructions.  Obtain a copy from
  CPAN.  You may find that you wish to create a configuration file to
  avoid repetition in the instructions included below.  It is probably
  worth reading the documentation to understand the text file it produces
  for editing.
* Markdown is used in the summaries.  Here is a brief introduction:
  [link name](http://www.google.com)
  <http://www.google.com>
  `foo` = C<foo>  
  `foo` = F<foo>
  _foo_ = I<foo>
  *foo* = B<foo>
* To include references to RT, use <rt://perl/12345>
* To cross-link to a thread also included in the summary, use
  <msgid:this.is.the.message.id@foo>
* If a thread should not be included in the summary, add the header
  'hidden: this is the reason why it is excluded'.
* Editor's information for use.perl.org is:

  The mailing list is: use.perl-editors-subscribe@perl.org

Weekly:

Basic process:
1.  Have mboxes created.
    ~/bin/mirror_nntp
2.  Copy proto.yaml.
3.  Import new threads.
    mailsum create -v -pdr -f 'august 1' -t 'august 19' -o 08-19.yaml -i p6_mailboxes/*.mbox
4.  Create a text file (don't use --save to edit in place).
    mailsum edit --save --hidden --links --posters --dates --misc 08-19.yaml > 08.19.txt
5.  Add summaries.
6.  Import text file if required.
    mailsum edit --load -i 08-19.yaml < 08-19.txt
7.  Repeat steps 2-5 as needed; you will be warned of new and out-of-date
    threads.  Remove 'out-of-date' from the message headers when you have
    updated it.
8.  Create a text file, spell check it, and import it.
    mailsum edit --save 08-19.yaml > 08.19.txt
9.  Edit headers and footers in the yaml file.  Typically, the header
    contains an interesting quote from the week's summaries.
10. Commit the file to the Pugs repository.
11. Generate standard HTML for ONLamp and Pugs.
    mailsum tohtml --body_only --compact 08-19.yaml > ~/.htdocs/pugs.html
12. Generate special HTML for Useperl.
    mailsum tohtml --body_only --compact --h2 p,b --h3 p,i 08-19.yaml > ~/.htdocs/useperl.html
13. Generate text for Perl6 announce.
    mailsum totext -s 08-19.yaml > 08-19-out.txt
14. Post.
