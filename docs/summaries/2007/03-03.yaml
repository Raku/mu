        "It seems you are presuming a Waterfall model of development here.  We're not doing the Waterfall, we're doing the Whirlpool, where the strange attractor whirls around with feedback at many levels but eventually converges on something in the middle.  In other words, a whirlpool sucks, but the trick is to position your whirlpool over your intended destination, and you'll eventually get there, though perhaps a bit dizzier than you'd like."

        subject: '[S09] "Whatever" indices and shaped arrays'
        summary: |-
          Jonathan Lang suggested dropping some specification from S09 which described
          how `*` works in conjunction with `+` and `-`.  He suggested using `[0]`
          for the first index instead of `*+0`.  Larry Wall added his thoughts,
          noting that it was 'shiny', but that nested `[]`s might not be visually
          appealing.
          
          Luke Palmer decided to mention Ruby's boolean truth model which he admires.
          With it, 'nil' and 'false' are false, and everything else--including an
          empty string and '0'--are true.  In summary he stated that simple rules
          are a blessing if you find the right ones, and that he's a fan of
          boolean predictability.
          
          The shaped arrays thread continued, and eventually Larry was satisfied
          and requested a patch to S09.

        subject: What criteria mark the closure of perl6 specification
        summary: |-
          Richard Hainsworth asked when the Perl 6 specification will be complete.
          He is eager to begin using Perl 6, but wants to see it stabilize.
          Geoffrey Broadwell was perfectly willing to work with a moving
          specification, so long as the current version of the specification
          was mostly implemented.  chromatic noted that this is what everyone
          wants.
          
          Geoffrey offered to write some tests which would demonstrate
          missing features, if someone could implement the features.  Gabor
          Szabo said that he wished there were many people writing tests
          for unimplemented features, as someone would surely implement
          the feature to make tests pass.
          
          There was a discussion on how out-of-date the Exegesis files are.
          Masak suggested porting the code examples in the Exegesis to current
          Perl 6, and storing them in the Pugs repository.  Herbert Breunung
          thought a disclaimer that they are outdated would be adequate.
          
          Patrick Michaud noted that the changes to the specification have not
          had a negative impact on the development of the Perl 6 on Parrot
          implementation; to the contrary, they have made the work easier.
          
          Smylers added that there is no point in freezing the specification if
          it turns out it can't be implemented.  Smylers felt that most of the
          current work is clarifying, rather than adding new features. 
          
          Larry Wall explained that Perl 6 development doesn't follow the
          Waterfall model.  He cannot design something without feedback from
          implementors.  The development model was described as a 'whirlpool'.

          chromatic replied that Parrot has `ManagedStruct` and `UnManagedStruct`
          PMCs for mapping complex C structures.  Patrick Michaud replied that
          the PIR libraries aren't working yet, but that implementing them should
          not be too difficult.  Audrey Tang also described the situation in
          Pugs.  Geoffrey wondered if he could follow the development status.
          He offered to write some tests.

        subject: request new Mapping|Hash operators
        summary: |-
          Darren Duncan believes that there is room for some additional convenience
          operators or functions which are used with mapping and hash values.  In
          particular, he would like the relational data model concept of a tuple.
          He feels that this could be satisfied with the data types `Mapping` and
          `Hash` with the addition of some common relational operators such
          as `join()`, `semijoin()`, `semidifference()`, `rename()`, `project()`,
          `remove()`, `compose()`, `wrap()`, and `unwrap()`.
          
          Nicholas Clark noted that `rename` is a Perl 5 builtin, which he doesn't
          believe has been dropped for Perl 6.  Smylers added that Perl already has
          a `join` function for renaming strings.  Darren reiterated that he isn't
          concerned with the names so much as the concepts they express.
          
          Aaron Crane wondered why Darren was specifically against putting this
          functionality into a third-party module.  Darren supplied an argument
          for the usefulness of relational operators in response.  Smylers pointed
          out that it would be odd to include core support for database operations
          when most people would opt to use DBI (a module) instead.  David Green
          wasn't concerned about whether the features were core or in a module,
          but thought it would be nice to have them.
          
          There was some discussion on whether certain features, such as renaming
          hash keys, are implemented in Perl 5, with David Green, Darren Duncan,
          Aaron Crane and Uri Guttman taking part.

          Geoffrey Broadwell asked how bitwise shifts are defined on low-level types.
          Smylers remarked that it is rare to deal with anything as low-level as
          bits in Perl 5 programming.  He feared that introducing more operators
          into the core language, especially if they would be rarely used, raises
          the entry barrier.
          
          Nicholas Clark added that it's something you don't want to do in Perl 5,
          because it is so bad at it.

        subject: Low-level types and over/underflow
        summary: |-
          Geoffrey Broadwell wanted to know what would happen if a low-level type
          underflows or overflows.  For example, if you incremented a `uint8` past
          255, what would be the result?
          
          Darren Duncan thought that it depended upon what the underlying hardware
          does.  He suspected it would be a wraparound or an overflow, not a type
          upgrade.

        summary: |-
          In this thread, Geoffrey Broadwell asked what happens when you cast between
          low-level types if the source value is out of range for the destination
          type.  Larry Wall replied that it would be an warning if the destination
          is an `int`, and a clip to infinities when the destination is a `num`.

          Geoffrey Broadwell wanted to know how you specify that you want to 
          byte-stringify a structure, rather than normally stringifying it.
          Larry Wall advised coercing to a buffer type rather than using `~`.

          Geoffrey Broadwell asked how casting and coercion are handled with
          expressions which involve mixing low- and high-level types.
          Larry Wall answered the question, and pointed to a recent update of
          S09.

          email, Paul thought that Parrotbug is confusing and should perhaps
          be removed.
          
          Jerome Quelin remarked that he has no time to work on Parrotbug,
          which he originally created.  He said that anyone willing to work
          on it was welcome to take over maintenance.

        summary: |-
          Klaas-Jan Stol tried to add a test which runs some PIR code as PBC.  He
          noted that a PBC file wasn't being created, and sent a patch which could
          fix this to ticket <rt://perl/41604>.  He also wondered if it was a good
          idea to store PBC files in the repository.
          
          Leopold Toetsch explained that the files which are in the repository are
          generated on different machines, and the tests check that Parrot can
          read PBCs from different platforms.
          
          Klaas-Jan wondered if `pbc_output_is` could take PIR code and compile
          it while running a test, or if it expects the PBC file to be present.
          Leopold confirmed that the PBC file must be present.
          
          Jerry Gay noted that there are no test functions which accept PIR,
          compile to PBC, and run the PBC.  He wasn't sure it was a good idea
          to add this functionality before the refactoring of Parrot::Test is
          complete.

          would be better to add some annotation in the `.ops` file.

        summary: |-
          Will Coleda created ticket <rt://perl/41612> because he noticed that
          Parrot hadn't passed on Windows since 0.4.6.  chromatic thought that
          0.4.9 would help resolve some of the recent failures.
          Patrick R. Michaud had seen a report of 0.4.9, and said there were
          still failures with positive and negative numbers very close to zero.

        summary: |-
          In ticket <rt://perl/41614>, Will Coleda reported some problems with
          adding an attribute to a TclProc PMC.  Alek Storm remarked that a Sub
          is not a ParrotObject, so it has nowhere to store attributes.  He
          submitted a patch which implements a basic storage system for TclProc.
          Will commented that it was annoying that attributes aren't just available
          everywhere, and that ParrotClass and PMC don't have much in common.

          Klaas-Jan Stol noted that most languages which can be run interactively
          print a welcome message.  He submitted a patch to give a message when
          interactive mode is entered, before printing a prompt.
          
          Patrick R. Michaud thought the effort was useful, but that it shouldn't
          mention help which isn't available.  Also, there was a bit of a problem
          with multi-line input.
          
          There was a bit of further discussion on the topic.

        subject: '[perl #41619] [PATCH] add add_attr, rem_attr, and rem_attr_str vtable methods '
        summary: |-
          In ticket <rt://perl/41619>, Alek Storm submitted a patch which adds
          several vtable methods which can be used by Ruby and Smalltalk.
          James E Keenan reported that the patch, when applied to the branch,
          did not cause any problems with tests.
          
          Allison Randal thought this raised a design issue.  She wanted to know
          why `add_attr`, `rem_attr` and `rem_attr_str` were vtable methods instead
          of methods on the Class class.  Alek thought that this was in line with
          PDD 15.  Joshua Isom was concerned about interoperability, and wondered
          if Perl 6 and Tcl (for example) would be able to use the new class 
          implementation.
          
          Alek replied that the vtable provides an abstract interface everyone
          can use seamlessly.  He thought that it would in fact encourage people
          to use multiple languages in a single application.
          
          chromatic asked Alek to clarify what behavior he wanted to enable in the
          HLL.  Alek said he would put together some code which would demonstrate
          his intention.  As of March 12th, he was still working on the use case.

        summary: |-
          Earlier, in ticket <rt://perl/41642>, Mehmet Yavuz Selim Soyturk
          reported a bug.  
          
          This week, Jonathan Worthington reported that he had fixed a bug 
          asked someone to check with the latest code.  Bob Rogers reported that
          Mehmet's test case works in r17298, but that it still fails for him
          even when the patch is applied.
          
          Later, Bob was able to look into the issue further, and found that
          there are some more serious problems and that he needs to think on
          how to solve them.
