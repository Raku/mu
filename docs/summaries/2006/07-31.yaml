          Audrey Tang wrote that Pugs 6.2.12 is available on CPAN, and listed some
          of the key features.  v6.pm, a prototype Perl 6 compiler implemented in
          Perl 5 is also available on CPAN.  She highlighted a number of modules 
          which had contributed toward the solution, such as Moose and
          Module::Compile.

          Conrad Schneiker had several questions for the group:  what key features
          should be in a FOSS tool suite involving Perl 6, what major existing
          components are recommended, and how people would design it to take
          advantage of new Perl 6 capabilities.

          Amir E. Aharoni wanted to know what the current state of the wiki
          plan is.  He was primarily interested in the content, rather than
          the implementation.  Conrad Schneiker replied that he felt a
          wiki should be installed on feather soon, to serve the need for
          documentation, and from there it would be possible to port the 
          wiki to Perl 6.

          In response to Audrey Tang's commit, Aaron Crane noted that he understood
          why 'environmental' had been changed to 'contextual' but questioned whether
          'contextual' was the best alternative because 'contexts' already have a
          meaning.  He proposed 'ambient variables'.  Audrey responded that a context
          is passed along with your calls, and in that sense 'want' is a contextual
          variable.

          Markus Laire had a question about Larry Wall's commit, namely, why
          `q:n[stuff]` is not acceptable, and in what way parenthesis are
          special.  Larry replied that `qn(stuff)` is always a function call,
          as is `q(foo)`; neither is a quote.  He said that he will clarify
          the distinction between quotes and macros.

          In response to Larry Wall's commit, Markus Laire asked how
          `q ()` is parsed, because quotes can have whitespace but functions
          cannot.  Larry replied that it is a quote.

          and invited Tom to contribute.

          Uri Guttman reported on the docathon.  There was a suggestion that Perl 6
          have a glossary with terms might not make sense to a newcomer not
          steeped in theory.  Uri proposed that someone be appointed pumpking
          of the master documentation.  Juerd suggested checking out the Perl 6
          Nomenclature document.  José Castro amended Uri's proposal to suggest
          that pronunciation always be included, for the benefit of non-native
          speakers.  Joel York volunteered to be pumpking.

          Paul Seamons suggested that CGI::Ex::Template might be of interest.

          Brad Bowman wrote about two sprintf features of Python which might be 
          nice to borrow.  Nicholas Clark was not certain that sprintf needs
          an operator.  Larry Wall noted that there was already sort of an
          operator, if infix `as` is considered a variant of `.as()`.

        summary: |-
          Following a question posed in <msgid:1152718832.28796.417.camel@pps>
          and a discussion on #perl6, Yuval Kogman posted several points that
          are not completely resolved.  He included a list of what he expects
          operators to return, and what they currently return in Pugs.  This
          led to a very long discussion, which also forked into
          <msgid:1152819873.28796.682.camel@pps>.
          
          The conclusion was that `===` did not do  what most people expected,
          and that the `eqv` operator exists for that purpose. Synopsis patches
          to clear up the explanations were applied.

        subject: 'S04 - forbidden coding-style'
        summary: |-
          Markus Laire noted a conflict between the way the Perl 6 grammar is
          defined, and the GNU coding standard for constructs like:
          
              loop
                {
                
                }
              while ( ... );
          
          Since this requires backtracking to disambiguate between while as a
          statement modifier and while as it's own loop.
          
          Many ideas were brought up, and the only real solution is to use a
          backslash escape for the newline, at the end of the line with the
          closing brace.

        summary: |-
          Bob Rogers requested some clarification of a portion of `pdd23_exceptions.pod`
          from late May, dealing with `.begin_eh`.  He wondered if this meant that
          the current process of searching for an Exception_Handler object on the
          control stack would be replaced with a search through sub metadata when
          an error is thrown, and asked about how it would interact with `pushaction`.
          Chip Salzenberg agreed that Bob's interpretation of the plan was
          correct and noted that no resolution had been reached with `pushaction`.
          A discussion on the merits of different ways of handling it ensued.

          that one should be a bug report.

          Jarkko Hietaniemi reported a problem with Parrot with `tgetnum`
          and asked if there was a way to add verbosity to show what commands
          are being run.  Leopold Toetsch advised `perl Configure.pl
          --verbose-step=snprintf`, and Jarkko included a more detailed report.
          Jarkko resolved to get the admins to compile a newer `libreadline`
          after some discussion with Leopold.  Will Coleda felt the test for
          readline should be improved.  There were some discussions on how
          to do this.

          Chip Salzenberg announced that the perl6-internals mailing list was
          renamed to parrot-porters in order to introduce it to a wider audience.
          He liked the name 'p-p' as an abbreviation for the list although he
          wasn't willing to actually stand by that statement.

        summary: |-
          Chip Salzenberg thinks that with `get_namespace` and the untyped
          namespace interface, `find_global` is obsolete.  Allison Randal
          felt that `find_global` shouldn't accept a namespace PMC as an
          argument.  Chip agreed with this.  Patrick R. Michaud also believed
          that `find_global` was a bit overloaded.  Allison further defined
          what was required.

          due to the `.namespace` changes, which Chip's patch would fix.
          Allison agreed with applying the patch.

          In <rt://perl/39826>, Jerry Gay reported that many scripts contain
          `perl -w`, but the minimum Perl version is 5.6.2, so these should
          mostly become `use warnings;`.  Swaroop supplied a patch, which
          was applied as r13505.

        summary: |-
          In ticket <rt://perl/39856>, Chromatic requested that Parrot be able
          to produce a single PBC file from a command like `parrot -o all_files.pbc
          file1.pir file2.pir ...`.  Joshua Hoblitt thought it would be a good
          idea to define how symbol conflicts should be handled.  Leopold
          Toetsch believed that `pbc_merge` can handle this, but Allison Randall
          explained that it doesn't quite address the request.  Chip Salzenberg
          felt that was a bug, although Allison preferred to call it a feature.
          Jerry Gay clarified how it worked by citing documentation and including
          tests.

          Shawn H. Corey reported that he was having problems installing Parrot
          following the README instructions and asked for help.  Jonathan Rockway
          offered suggestions.  
          
          This led to Chris Dolan noting that he thought ICU was recommended but
          not required, but that he could not find documentation on the subject.
          
          Later, Shawn also posted some replies he'd received
          from Andy Lester, for inclusion in a FAQ.  Patrick R. Michaud advised
          against installing Parrot because of the potential for collisions
          between installed and local Parrot copies.
          
          Further help was given in <msgid:44C12526.4070104@magma.ca>.

        summary: |-
          Luca Regini wondered if it might be possible to rename 
          `../include/parrot/string.h` to something like 
          `../include/parrot/parrot_string.h` because `string.h` collides with
          a file of the name in the standard C library, causing issues with 
          `SPLINT`.  Jerry Gay and Andy Lester thought the change would be
          fine so long as Parrot compiles and passes tests afterwards.

          Ron Blaschke added some functions, `Parrot_math_isnan` and
          `Parrot_math_finite` and asked if there was a good way to test
          if the platform supplies IEEE recommended functions like `_finite`
          and `_isnan` and use them if they are available.  Bill Coffman
          replied that there is no platform independent way to produce
          Nan or Inf, but offered some optimization tips.
          
          NaN and infinity were also discussed in

        summary: |-
          Bob Rogers included a patch he was not sure he should apply.  The patch
          defined `Parrot_rewind_stack` as a stub, changed `Continuation:invoke` to
          use the stub, and modified tests.  Problems with the patch are that it
          doesn't invoke the actions in the right dynamic environment, and it
          is linear in the current stack depth instead of linear in the number of
          entries that must be traversed.  He asked if the patch should be applied,
          postponed, or replaced with a more comprehensive fix.

          bytecode from disk.

        subject: Inf and NaN
        summary: |-
          Matt Diephouse proposed implementing three types of core PMCs: NaN,
          Inf and NegInf.  Jerry Gay reminded Matt about negative-not-a-number,
          and there was some discussion about whether -NaN exists, which led to
          the question of whether the fact that `NaN != NaN` unless there is 
          optimization in the comparison could be used in isnan and finite tests.
          
          There was also discussion on infinity and NaN in thread

          Leopold Toetsch reported that r13703 makes some incompatible API
          changes.  It replaces the global `exit_handler_list` with an
          interpreter field, and changes `Parrot_on_exit`, `Parrot_exit` and
          other exit_handlers to officially take an Interp* argument.

          Allison Randal asked if it was a bug or a feature that no matter
          which whitespace rule matches, if `:sigspace` is on, newlines are
          treated as ignorable whitespace.  Patrick R. Michaud found a reference
          in S12 which defines the search order for rules.

          Audrey Tang reported that the CPAN version of v6.pm now passes all
          Pugs sanity tests.  She is especially pleased with the independent
          layers, which allow people to use modules like Class::MOP and Data::Bind
          without switching to the v6 interface.

        subject: making v6 test suite its own distro
        summary: |-
          Darren Duncan suggested further decoupling implementations from the
          Perl 6 specifications by distributing the Perl 6 test suite as its
          own distribution, so that v6.pm does not require Pugs just to test it. 
          Gaal Yahas mentioned some of his concerns, and pointed out the Chimps
          project, which is trying to do something similar.  There was also some
          discussion on whether requiring support for features in Test.pm should
          be a requirement for an implementation.  Jerry Gay also joined the
          discussion.
