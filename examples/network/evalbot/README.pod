=head1 NAME

Evalbot

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a small IRC bot using C<Net::IRC> to C<eval()> commands.

=head1 ARCHITECTURE

C<evalbot.p6> is the main bot, written in Perl 6. To run a command, it spawns
C<evalhelper.p5>, a Perl 5 program. This sets up the necessary environment
(C<PUGS_SAFEMODE>, redirection of C<STDOUT> and C<STDERR> to a temporary file,
resource limits, etc.). Finally, C<evalhelper.p5> runs C<pugs>.

=head1 INSTALLATION

There's no separate installation step needed, simply run C<evalbot.p6> and
supply a nick and an IRC server to connect to:

    $ pugs evalbot.p6 evalbot6 irc.freenode.net:6667

You don't have to restart C<evalbot.p6> when you install a new Pugs, as a new
C<pugs> is spawned on each command to eval.

C<evalhelper.p5> needs the C<BSD::Resource> module to be able to set
appropriate resource limits, so you can't run Evalbot under Win32.

=head1 REMOTE CONTROL

Once C<evalbot.p6> is connected to IRC, everybody can send it expressions to
eval:

    <you>     ?eval 42
    <evalbot> 42

Because of C<BSD::Resource> and Pugs's safemode, Evalbot should be able to
withstand most attacks (infinite loops, huge memory consumption, unsafe I/O,
etc. etc.):

    <you>     ?eval while 1 {}
    <you>     ?eval my $str = "42" x 1_000_000_000_000
    <you>     ?eval system "rm -rf /"
    <you>     ?eval say "\nPRIVMSG foo :bar"
    <you>     ?eval say "flood\n" x 1_000
    # etc.

Note that the return value of an expression is not printed directly, but
instead the C<.perl> method is called to prettyprint the result:

    <you>     ?eval "hi"
    <evalbot> 'hi'              # (note that quotes)

This behaviour may be confusing at first, especially if you intended to use
C<&say> to output something:

    <you>     ?eval say "hi"
    <evalbot> hi bool::true     # (the bool::true is say("hi")'s return value)

There're other commands available, too:

    <you>     ?help
    <evalbot> evalbot6 -- ?help | ?quit [reason] | ?raw ...
            | ?join #chan | ?uptime | ?eval code
