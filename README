Historical Information
======================

This used to be the pugs repository, but is nowadays a generic repository
for hosting anything related to the Raku Programming Language.  In particular,
it contains the standard grammar, some implementations like SMOP,
mildew, v6 and elf, various Raku examples, documentation efforts and examples.

Other parts of the former pugs repository have been moved to other
repositories:

    pugs            https://github.com/audreyt/Pugs.hs
    spectests       https://github.com/Raku/roast
    specs           https://github.com/Raku/specs
    raku.org       https://github.com/Raku/raku.org
    src/perl6       https://github.com/Raku/std
    perl5/          https://github.com/Raku/p5-modules
    misc/evalbot    https://github.com/Raku/evalbot


If you have any questions, don't hesitate to to ask on the
irc://libera.chat/#raku IRC channel, or send an email to
perl6-users@perl.org. Do the same to obtain a commit
bit for this repository.

Many outdated things have been removed from this repository. If you still want
to see them, check out revision r30211 (git sha1 6f0203060f) (check it at https://github.com/Raku/mu/tree/6f0203060f2ff65dfd1227e927b5c87d77640970), which was shortly before the big cleaning.

The only limitations are: be friendly, stay on topic (projects in here should
be related to Raku in some way) and only put free software in here.

All code and documentation in this repository is considered as shared, so you
