elfparse - getting STD.pm running on elf.

QUICKSTART

$ make known_working_STD
$ make check
$ make all
$ ./elfblue -v -s -e 'say 3'
$ make is_perl_recent_enough
$ ./elfgreenstd -v -e 'say /<STD::number>/.match("23").match_describe'
$ ./elfgreen -v -e 'proto token foo {a}; token foo:<+> { \+ }; token foo:<++> { \+\+ }; say /<foo>/.match("a++b").match_describe'

$ make does_gimme5_memory_problem_still_exist

INTRODUCTION

STD_blue is a parser for elf, which uses the p5 src/perl6/gimme5.
STD_green is a parser for elf, which runs std.pm on elfgreen.


elf_h is the foundational elf.  It uses STD_red.

elfblue is a (tweaked) elf which uses STD_blue instead of STD_red.
Purpose: keep STD_blue support working.

elfgreen is like elfblue, and has regex support.
Purpose: regex development.

elfgreenstd is like elfgreen, and includes std.pm.
Purpose: std.pm debugging.

VISION

Combine elfblue, elf_h, and rx_on_re, and teach them to compile and
run STD.pm.  Thus permitting the front-end to be bootstrapped.

NOTES

Dependencies:
autobox Class::Multimethods Sub::Name #elf
Regexp::Common #rx_on_re
Moose #gimme5

gimme5, and thus STD_blue, is not quite ready to replace STD_red as
the primary elf parser.
 Speed has greatly improved - is it comparable yet?
 Memory usage on encountering foofix:<bar> decls is a non-starter?
  (but... could :sym<>-ify elf?).
 elf IRFromAST2 support for STD_blue's AST needs work.
 If running STD.pm using rx_on_re in elf works out, then switching isn't
  critical path.  But if it bogs down, that may change..

PrimitivesP5.pm is a tweaked copy of elf_h's - gimme5 takes more memory
than I have available to compile the original.

IRx1_FromAST2_create.pl is a mess, with an unfortunate quantity of broken
legacy code.  The only objective was "get to self compilation", so general
p6 support is lacking, even by elf standards.


make check  runtime:
r24098 takes me 9m35s'user (with STD_red cached, and STD_blue not cached).

Success looks like:
- STD_blue can parse STD.pm.
- elfblue can generate IR for STD.pm.
- an elf can run the non-rx portions of STD.pm.
- rx_on_re can run the rx portions of STD.pm.
- rx_on_re is integrated into an elf.
- an elf can run STD.pm
- an elf can self-compile using STD.pm.
