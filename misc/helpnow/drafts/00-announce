This Week's Contribution to Perl 6

<p>Some people think that contributing to Perl 6 (or any advanced
programming language project, for that matter) is hard, complicated, and
requires you to write scary compiler guts.</p>

<p>The truth is that there are plenty ways to help, and most of them are not
scary at all. We, the Perl 6 developers, want to show you how. We will post a
series of challenges/task, one per week. Each challenge will be mostly
self-contained, and should be quite solvable for somebody with some basic
Perl 6 knowledge, some of them even without any knowledge of Perl 6.</p>

<p>There will also be some initial tips together with each challenge, pointers
to documentation if necessary, and the offer to answer all questions that
might arise while working on the problem.</p>

<p>If you successfully complete a challenge, you'll have the chance to win
some nice stuff (T-shirts for now, but we are looking for sponsors for more).
If you contribute a patch for <a href="http://rakudo.org/">Rakudo</a>, and
your patch gets applied, your name will appear in the next release
announcement - fame and eternal glory are are certain.</p>

<p>Sponsors:
<ul>
    <li>2 T-shirts (Rakudo or Perl 6) from moritz</li>
    <li>YOUR NAME AND DONATION HERE (I'm looking for more sponsors right now)</li>
</ul>
