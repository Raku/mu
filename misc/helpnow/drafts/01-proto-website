This Week's Contribution to Perl 6 Week 1: A website for proto

<p>For this week's contribution to Perl 6 you don't need to write or
understand a single line of Perl 6 code - Perl 5 or another scripting language
woorks fine.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>As <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node_id=837535">explained here</a>,
we don't have a proper CPAN for Perl 6 yet - only a very coarse
<a href="http://github.com/masak/proto/">prototype installer</a>.</p>

<p>It has <a
href="http://github.com/masak/proto/raw/master/projects.list">list of known
projects</a> in its source repository.</p>

<h2>What you can do</h2>

<p>Write a script that downloads this file, and for each project extracts the
one-line project description from the respective github pages.</p>

<p>It should use the assembled data to build a website that links to all the
projects, and contains their names and descriptions.</p>

<p>You'll get bonus points if you make the list of projects, descriptions
and URLs available in JSON format too.</p>
