Perl 6 Advent Calendar
 <http://perl6advent.wordpress.com/>

So, the idea of the Perl 6 Advent calendar is that every day, there's a
small blog post written by someone, about something they like in Perl 6.
It may be a Perl 6 feature, or a set of features, or a cool little
script, or a best practice. Anything, really. The fact that it can be
referred to as something to write about already merits it as a topic.
