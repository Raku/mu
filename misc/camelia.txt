Subject: Re: Logo considerations

[...] I think there's a tendency to
go way too abstract in most of these proposals.  I want something
with gut appeal on the order of Tux.  In particular I want a logo
for Perl 6 that is:

    Fun
    Cool
    Cute
    Named
    Lively
    Punable
    Personal
    Concrete
    Symmetric
    Asymmetric
    Attractive
    Relational
    Metamorphic
    Decolorizable
    Shrinkable to textual icon
    Shrinkable to graphical icon

In addition, you can extend just about anything by attaching "P6"
wings to it.  I also take it as a given that we want to discourage
misogyny in our community.  You of the masculine persuasion should
consider it an opportunity to show off your sensitive side.  :)

Hence, Camelia.

Yes, I went out of my way to indicate that my mind was still open
(a little).  However, if you will allow an old geezer to be a wee bit
testy, I would also like to make it clear that I'm a just a little
tired of these "rounds"; more importantly, that I've been mulling
over this particular issue for many years.  I didn't just come up
with that list of requirements off the cuff.  I'm old enough to have
lots of stuff on my cuff as well.

Also, it's probably mere hubris, but I already consider myself to be a
"professional designer".  I know how to take into account the various
factors that a professional designer would take into account when
designing yet another highly original logo that somehow ends up looking
just like every other logo out there.  You'll notice that "sterility"
is not on my list of requirements.  It was a deliberate omission.

So let me summarize the requirements into a meta-requirement:

    The new logo must make Larry at least as happy as Camelia does.

That is the extent to which my mind is still open...  :-)
