FAQ.

Q.  99 != 84.  What gives?
A.  Who knows?  I didn't write 'em.

Q.  Are they done?
A.  Nope.  Probably never will be, even if all are answered.  Find a problem
and see if you can solve it.  The lower the problems number, the more likely
it has been "solved".  (This FAQ was written immediately after solving
problem 24).

Q.  Your solution is a big bucket of suck.  I can do better.
A.  Feel free!  But don't erase other solutions, add to them and update the
test count.

Q.  Why did you do X when it's clearly not the best way?
A.  I've tried to get all of the examples to compile under the current version
of Pugs (6.2.13 (r14927)).  This was primarily to see if I could really get
working Perl 6 code.  For example, problem 24 has the following statement:

  my %unique = map sub {$_ => 1}, @numbers;

That's probabably better written as:

  my %unique = map {$_ => 1}, @numbers;

Right now, Perl 6 seems to be very keen on turning {} into a hash reference.

Q.  Some answers don't quite match the problem statement.  Why not?
A.  Because Perl 6 naturally expresses some things differently.  For example,
some problems imply that the starting index of lists is '1'.  I chose '0'
because that's how most programming languages (including Perl 6) do it.

Q.  Why do some of the problems refer to Prolog?
A.  Because Prolog is truly a sublime language and these problems were
originally written in Prolog
(http://www.hta-bi.bfh.ch/~hew/informatik3/prolog/p-99/).

Q.  Where are the images the problems refer to?
A.  See the link in the previous FAQ question.
