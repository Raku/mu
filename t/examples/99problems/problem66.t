# P66 (***) Layout a binary tree (3)
# 
# Yet another layout strategy is shown in the illustration opposite. The method
# yields a very compact layout while maintaining a certain symmetry in every
# node. Find out the rules and write the corresponding Prolog predicate. Hint:
# Consider the horizontal distance between a node and its successor nodes. How
# tight can you pack together two subtrees to construct the combined binary
# tree?
# 
# Use the same conventions as in problem P64 and P65 and test your predicate in
# an appropriate way. Note: This is a difficult problem. Don't give up too
# early!
# 
# Which layout do you like most?
