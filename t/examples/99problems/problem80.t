# Write predicates to convert between the different graph representations. With
# these predicates, all representations are equivalent; i.e. for the following
# problems you can always pick freely the most convenient form. The reason this
# problem is rated (***) is not because it's particularly difficult, but because
# it's a lot of work to deal with all the special cases.
