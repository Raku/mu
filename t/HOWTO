=head1 How to add tests to the test suite

This is a guide on how to add tests to the official Perl 6 test suite.

=head2 Pro Forma

All file paths in this directory are relative to the root of the pugs
repository (unless stated otherwise). You can obtain the pugs SVN repository
by typing

   svn co http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs

A file path C<t/spec/> is the directory that can be obtained from
C<http://svn.pugscode.org/pugs/t/spec/>.

The test suite lives in C<t/>, and is slowly being moved to C<t/spec/>

=head2 Where to start?

First pick a language feature you want to test. If you don't know what to test
and just want to test something, look at the file F<t/TASKS>, it contains a
list of stuff that needs testing.

=head2 Check the other tests first

Many things are already tested, and it would be waste of time to duplicate the
effort, and a maintenance burden. So first check if there are tests for the
things you want. Usually a very efficient method is to do a full text search
on the current test suite, either with C<grep> or C<ack> (a perl replacement
for grep, see L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/ack>).

Suppose you want to know if the method C<pick> is already implemented. You'd
go into C<t/> and then type:

    $ ack -l '\bpick\b'
    examples/99problems/problem80.t
    examples/99problems/problem24.t
    examples/99problems/problem25.t
    examples/99problems/problem23.t
    spec/fudge
    spec/S03-junctions/misc.t
    spec/fudgeall
    spec/S03-operators/assign.t
    spec/S29-list/pick.t
    junction/junction_any_pick.t
    junction/junction_functions.t
    junction/junction_pick.t

Anything that doesn't end in C<.t> can be ignored for now. You see that there
are even files with C<pick> in their name, so you can be pretty sure it's
already tested.

If you didn't find any tests, or the existing ones aren't covering all cases,
go on with the next step.

=head2 Where to Put the Tests?

If there are already similar tests to those you want to add, just put them
into the same file.

If you're writing completely new tests, find a spot below C<t/spec/> where it
fits.

The typical file name of a test is C<t/spec/S29-list/map.t>. C<S29> is
the synopsis where the feature is described, it can be found at
L<http://design.perl6.org/S29.html>. C<list> is the section within S29 where
the feature is described, and C<map> is the feature being tested.

Please adhere to this style as good as possible, when you are in doubt, ask on
#perl6 on irc.freenode.org. Words in test file names should be separated by
hyphens, eg C<S99-weird/very-weird-features.t>.

=head2 Write the Tests

The test suite uses the "Test Anything Protocol" (short TAP), and a module
named C<Test> that produces the appropriate output. Perl 5 programmers will
be familiar with it because it's very much like L<Test::More>.

Suppose you'd want to test the power operator C<**>. Your test file might
be looking something like this:

    use v6;
    use Test;
    plan 4;

    is 2**4,    16, 'Can calculate power of integers';
    is (-2)**3, -8, 'Can calculate power of negative integers';
    is_approx 2**0.5, sqrt(2), 'Can use fractional exponents';
    is 0**30,    0, '0**$something is 0 again';

Let's go through this line by line.

The first line tells the compiler that it is
a Perl 6 source file, not Perl 5. The second one loads the C<Test> module.

C<plan 4;> says "we're planning to run 4 tests in this file". If for example
the test silently dies during execution, the TAP parser knows how many tests
you planned to run, and raises an error if it didn't run that many.

The next line is our first real test. It calls the C<is()> function with three
arguments: the first is the expression whose value is being tested (C<2**4>),
the second is the expected value (C<16>), and the third is a short description
of what the test does.

The next three lines are similar in spirit. Note that the third test uses
C<is_approx> instead of C<is>, because it deals with floating point values,
and direct comparison of floating point values is nearly always wrong.

=head2 Smartlinks

The test suite uses so-called "smartlinks" to identify which test files cover
which parts of the synopsis. Please add at least one smartlink to each test
file that you write.

Smart links are covered in more detail here:

    http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/08/integrating_the.html
    http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/09/check_smoke_res.html
    http://pugs.blogs.com/pugs/2006/09/the_benefits_of.html

C<t/README> also contains some information on how smartlinks work.

In our example we'd go into C<docs/Perl6/Spec> where the synopsis live, and
search for occurrences of C<**>:

    ack -Q '**'

This returns many results. The ones from C<Rule.pod> are mostly unrelated
to the operator we just tested, because C<Rule.pod> describes regular
expressions, and C<**> has a different meaning there.

The best match seems to be C<Operator.pod>. Looking at
L<http://design.perl6.org/> reveals that it's also called S03 for short. So
we know that our smartlink will start with C<< L<S03/> >>. Next we find out
which section the best match is. That's C<Exponentiation precedence> in our
case, so our smartlink looks like this:
C<< L<S03/Exponentiation precedence/> >>.

The only thing missing is to identify the paragraph. Instead of copying
the markup, we just use a part of what will be displayed, and put it
in double quotes:
C<< L<S03/Exponentiation precedence/"infix:<**>"> >>. We place that line
directly after the C<plan> directive in our test file.

=head2 Committing your changes

Once you've written (or edited) a reasonable test file, you should commit the
changes to the pugs repository.
If you don't have a commit bit (that is the power to commit changes to the
repository) join #perl on irc.freenode.net and ask for one.

If you merely edited a test file, a simple
C<svn ci> will do:

    svn ci -m '[t/spec] added tests for $frobnicate_feature' path/to/file.t

If you created a new file, you have to call C<svn add> first and set the svn
properties. Lazy programmers use a shell script for that:

    ./util/add-text-file.sh t/spec/S99-weird/very-weird-features.t
    svn ci -m '[t/spec] test for very weird features' t/spec/S99-weird/very-weird-features.t

Please always include the C<[t/spec]> marker at the beginning of your commit
messages (or C<[t]> if you didn't modify C<t/spec/>), it helps others to
identify which part of the repository you changed.
