KindaPer6 specification

- in short: lexical subs and classes; metamodel interface; begin blocks; containers
  - see individual files: 
    begin-block.pod
    lexical-class.pod
    lexical-subs.pod

- compilable with MP6, only until KP6 bootstraps
  - MP6 spec is now frozen

- pluggable, maybe hot pluggable:
  grammar, object system, and the workflow itself

  The initial default grammar engine could be reused from MP6  
  Parrot backend could use TGE/PGE
  Perl5 backend could use PCR, MO, Moose

# Milestones

- finish kp6-spec

    Such that we know when it's finished

- lexical subs 

    Allows operator redefinition:
    
    my multi infix:<+> { ... }

    But note that 'multi' is not part of the kp6 spec

- lexical classes / first-class classes

    Better support for grammar mutability

    $?GRAMMAR   Which grammar am I in? (from S02)
    @?GRAMMAR   Which nested grammars am I in?
        
- metamodel interface

    Allow pluggable object models

- begin blocks

    This is needed to support separate compilation - that is, separate compile-time from run-time 

- containers

    This is needed to implement assignment - MP6 only supported binding.

# Compiler

- Pads and OO are implemented as external module calls
- Containers?

    class Pad {
     has %!myvars;
     has Pad $.outer;
    
     method lookup(String $var) {
       return %!myvars{$var} if exists %!myvars{$var};
       return $.outer.lookup($var);
     }
     method set(String $var, $val) {
       %!myvars{$var} = $val if exists %!myvars{$val};
       return $.outer.lookup($var, $val);
     }
     ...
    }

    from MiniPerl6-MO:
    ---        
    - "class" is a macro. It expands to a "module", with calls to MO.
      The "module" AST is like:
    
      # A module is a "class" without the methods and attributes.
      class Module {
        has $.name          is Str;                     # Module Name;
        has $.body          is Lit::Code;               # body of code
      }
    
    - Macros are implemented in the grammar.
    - It might be better to implement syntax for macros first, and then
      implement "token" and "class" using real macros
    
    - Method calls can either be implemented with mo subroutine calls, or native method calls. 
      It depends on the emitter

    my $base = MO::Compile::Class::MI->new();
    
    my $point = MO::Compile::Class::MI->new(
    	superclasses => [ $base ],
    	instance_methods => [
    		MO::Compile::Method::Simple->new(
    			name       => "distance",
    			definition => sub {
    				my ( $self, $other_point ) = @_;
    				die "stub";
    			}
    		),
    	],
    	attributes => [
    		MO::Compile::Attribute::Simple->new(
    			name => "x",

# Differences from MiniPerl6

- assignment with '='

- inheritance

- trait blocks


# Wish list

- macros


# Extensibility

KP6 extensibility should make it is possible to implement Perl6 using it.
Some test cases could be (as long as the backend supports it):

- 'my' subroutines
  - p5 backend can use Sub::Lexical instead (but it is a source filter)
- 'my' classes
    - lexical grammar changes, such as
      my multi infix:<+> ...
      - the p6-parser is executed in the lexical context under compilation
    ---
    <TimToady> when you're building the candidate list for a particular multi dispatch, it goes outward in the scopes and finds any candidates whose long name is not hidden by an inner scope
    <TimToady> finally it adds in all the global multies
    <fglock> I think what I mean is, the whole grammar is inside the scope
    <TimToady> logically, yes
    <TimToady> reverts to previous grammar at }
    <fglock> rather than being a simple external module
    <TimToady> yes, you generally have to construct an anonymous grammar
    <TimToady> and that anon grammar may well be based on the OUTER:: anonymous grammar
    <TimToady> the current grammar is also passed to eval, i think.
    <TimToady> but not to require
    <TimToady> so in the case of eval you need to remember the current grammar in $?GRAMMAR till run time
    <TimToady> that anonymous grammar is where you probably want to store the modified infix etc. tables
    <TimToady> rather than just temporizing, or in addition to temporizing
    <TimToady> basically a GC problem; if anything refers to $?GRAMMAR you keep it around.

- 'coro'

- junctions


# Desugarings to MP6

- metamodel calls for OO

- cps - continuation-passing style

- explicit pads as program data
  - not really needed - see note below
- special blocks: BEGIN, LAST, ...
  note - p5 can access pad structures using closures:
  --- Perl 6 source
    module Main;
    my $y;  
    my $z; 
    BEGIN { 
        my $x;  
        $y = { $x };   
        $z = { $x } 
     }
  --- Perl 5 run-time
    INIT { 
        Main::_begin_001_(); 
    }
    package Main;
    my $y;  
    my $z; 
    sub _begin_001_ {
        my $x;  
        $y = sub { $x };   
        $z = sub { $x } 
    }
  ---

- parameter binding 
  - already done by mp6, but it's incomplete


# AST transformation engine

Desugaring is processed by the ast-transformation engine

    compiler workflow
        ->
    @visitors ---> visitor composer ---> AST traverser
